# Ghasem Abdi

**I am a global expert in multi-modal imaging technology, with a strong focus on modern computer vision and innovative computational geometry solutions for generating spatial and descriptive information from multiple data sources, such as LiDAR, optical, RADAR, and thermal sources, collected from space, aerial, terrestrial, and underwater sources. I lead the development of geo-intelligence for [Terris Earth Intelligence](https://www.terrisei.com/), a cloud-based AI platform that seamlessly fuses and projects 3D visualizations with AI-driven analytics to facilitate faster and more informed decision-making for any place on earth.**
